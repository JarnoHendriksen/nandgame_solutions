## Logic gates

<a name="nand-gate"></a>

### Nand

![Nand gate consisting of two default-on relays. The first relay takes the inputs A and B, and the second relay takes the output of the first one as control, and the constant 1 as input.](Solutions/Hardware/LogicGates/Nand.png)

<a name="inverter"></a>

### Invert

![Inverter consisting of a nand gate, with both input terminals hooked up to the single input value.](Solutions/Hardware/LogicGates/Invert.png)

<a name="and-gate"></a>

### And

![And gate consisting of a nand gate followed by an inverter.](Solutions/Hardware/LogicGates/And.png)

<a name="or-gate"></a>

### Or

![Or gate consisting of a nand gate, with both inputs inverted.](Solutions/Hardware/Or.png)

<a name="xor-gate"></a>

### Xor

![Xor gate consisting of 4 nand gates. Gate 1 takes the inputs A and B. Gate 2 takes A and the output of gate 1. Gate 3 takes B and the output of gate 1. Gate 4 takes the outputs of gates 3 and 4.](Solutions/Hardware/LogicGates//Xor.png)
